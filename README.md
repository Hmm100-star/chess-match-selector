This project automates the process of pairing chess players for their next matches based on three main factors:
	1.	Player Strength – computed from their win/loss record and homework accuracy.
	2.	Color Balance – how many times each player has played white or black.
	3.	Homework Performance – whether they completed or performed well on their assigned work.

The goal is to produce balanced, fair, and instructive matchups that encourage learning and maintain parity in experience across the group.

The program will:
	•	Read data from a CSV (like Student_Information - Sheet1.csv).
	•	Calculate a composite strength rating for each player.
	•	Pair players with similar ratings while balancing black/white assignments.
	•	Export the results as a new CSV (ready for Excel or Google Sheets).
